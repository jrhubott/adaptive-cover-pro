"""Cover-state-change classification for manual-override detection.

`StateClassifier` is the single piece of code that decides whether a
post-command cover state change represents the integration's own transit
(grace period, mid-transit pause, forward progress, settle) or genuine
user activity (manual override).  The logic stays *byte-for-byte
equivalent* to the body that lived inline on the coordinator before this
extraction — every issue-fix comment is preserved verbatim.  Refactoring
this code is not in scope; relocating it is.

Background — the inline implementation accumulated five issue-numbered
behaviour fixes over its lifetime:

- **#147** — clearing wait_for_target on intermediate states caused
  user-initiated moves to be mis-attributed to ACP.
- **#172** — startup motor-engagement delay must keep wait_for_target so
  ACP-commanded covers aren't false-flagged before they move.
- **#186** — step-motor covers briefly report a non-transitional state
  between pulses; restart the grace period instead of clearing.
- **#271** — progress-aware backstop: clear wait_for_target only after
  *transit_timeout* seconds without forward progress, so slow-but-moving
  covers are not prematurely cleared.
- **#285** — direction/progress check runs for covers that never emit
  "opening"/"closing", based purely on position delta.

The classifier is composed by :class:`CoverCommandService` and accessed
through its public :meth:`classify_state_change` wrapper.  External state
flows in as keyword arguments:

- ``target_just_reached`` is a ``set[str]`` owned by the coordinator and
  *mutated in place* — the coordinator reads it from another handler
  inside the same event lifecycle, and changing that contract is out of
  scope for this phase.
- ``grace_mgr`` is the same :class:`GracePeriodManager` the cover
  command service already composes; it is passed by argument here so the
  classifier never reaches back into the service for it.
